Content of this section:
- script.js: contain the content code in ES6
- challenge.js: contain challenge code

Features of ES6:

1. Variable Declaration with let and const: 
- const is used to declare constant. Unable to assign the Variable
to any value. If assign const variable to a value, there would be an error
- ES5 doesn't have const keyword to declare variables, ES6 does. 

- 'let' and 'const' have block scope
and 'var' have the function scope

2. Blocks and IIFEs: 
- can write any code with in {}, see the code for more info

3. String:
See notes for:
- String Concatenation in ES6
- String functions in ES6

4. Arrow Functions: 
- map() function is used in an array to get a new array
with the processing function 
- Arrow Function is a short way to write function


5. Destructuring: the oposite of constructing

- destructuring is the proccess of assigning
different parts of a data structure into different variables
- constructuring is the process of forming
a data structure with different data
- application of destructuring is to return multiple
values of a function

6. Arrays: Utilities of Array in ES6
- Nodelist to Array Utility
- ES6 for loop 
- findIndex() Utility

7. The Spread Operator: 
- SPREAD OPERATOR TAKES AN ARRAY AND TRANSFORM IT 
INTO DIFFERENT VALUES
- SPREAD OPERATOR IS USED IN A FUNCTION CALL
- See code for example

8. Rest and Default Parameters: 
a. Rest Parameters: 
    REST PARAMETERS TAKES SOME SINGLE VALUES 
    AND TRANSFORM IT INTO AN ARRAY

    REST PARAMETERS HAVE THE SAME NOTATION
    AS THE SPREAD OPERATOR WITH THE 3 DOTS: 
    '...'

    EVEN THOUGH THE NOTATION OF SPREAD AND REST OPERATOR
    ARE SIMILIAR, 
    SPREAD OPERATOR IS USED IN A FUNCTION CALL
    REST OPERATOR IS USED IN A FUNCTION DECLARATION

b. Default Parameters:
- See code example

9. Maps: 
- Maps is a data structure that store data

MAP IS GOOD BECAUSE: 
    
    - MAP CAN USE ANYTHING AS KEY, OPEN 
    MORE POSSIBILITIES

    - MAP IS IRRITABLE, OBJECT ISN'T

    - MAP IS EASY TO GET THE SIZE OF THE MAP

10. Classes and subclasses: 
    ES 5 ONLY HAS FUNCTION CONSTRUCTOR, METHODS 
    AND EXTRA FIELDS HAS TO BE ADD VIA PROTOTYPE
    FIELD.

    ES6 CLASSES PROVIDE A BETTER AND EASIER TO 
    USE BLUEPRINT FOR OBJECT USAGE

    ALSO IT IS EASIER FOR INHERITANCE WITH ES6 CLASSES

    NOTE THAT YOU CANT USE HOISTING IN CLASSES
    YOU HAVE TO DECLARE IT FIRST TO USE IT
